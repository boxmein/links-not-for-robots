# links not for robots

wanna send a link you don't want robots to browse? or the NSA? use this handy 
website to block robots from entering!

oh, and as an extra, links will work forever, since link data is literally kept
inside the URL (except it's encrypted with symmetrical magic, so only this site 
can decipher it, unless you can get to the private key... >:)

therefore, this does not serve as an URL shortener, rather an URL obfuscator. 

## Usage

Running this program is simple: 

    $ npm install && npm start

, where `npm` is the Node Package Manager. You ought to also have the [Node.js][node] 
runtime.
